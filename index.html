            <h1>The trend...</h1>
            <p>Isekai is a Japanese genre that describes stories in which individuals are transported
                to a different world to accomplish a certain goal.
            </p>

            <p>It has become a common resouce in these stories
                that the main protagonist(s) become extremely powerful, often to absurd levels that people
                consider "overpowered" in the alternate reality. However, there is always some explanation for why
                this happens.

            <h1>Sword Art Online (SAO)</h1>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
                This story takes place in Aincrad, a virtual fantasy world where players' minds were
                transported through a neural device, the NerveGear. On the release day, it was announced that
                players would not be able to log out, and dying in the game would also kill them in real life.
                To escape they must beat 100 floors full of countless enemies and obstacles.
            </p>

            <h2>The Fastest Swordman</h2>
            <p>
                Kirito is the main character. He is one of the few beta testers who had the chance to play
                the video game before its release. Bringing all the information he gained from previously testing
                the game made him incredibly powerful in Aincrad. Kirito knew many secrets to beat each floor and
                progress ridiculously fast in the game.

            <h1>I'm Standing on a Million Lives</h1>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>
                A group of 3 high schoolers is transported to a series of games where they are prompted to
                complete missions by an unknown being. It is later revealed that their missions take place
                in alternate worlds, striking the morality of the main characters since they killed many
                people during those missions.
            </p>

            <h2>Morality</h2>
            <p>
                The three protagonists will respawn if they die during their missions as long as one of them stays
                alive. Since they are almost invincible, the story loses focus on whether they will succeed or not.
                Instead, it takes the approach of giving a moral lesson, depicting how regular people would react
                if placed into the role of a main character in a fantasy world.
